# Daraz E-Commerce Website README

## Overview
This project is a static HTML representation of a Daraz e-commerce webpage. It showcases a variety of products, categories, and features typical of an online shopping platform, including flash sales, product listings, and category navigation.

## File Description
- **daraz.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure and content of the Daraz e-commerce webpage. It includes:
  - A header with navigation links (e.g., Save more on app, Sell on Daraz, Help & Support, Login, Signup).
  - A search bar for product searches.
  - Sections for Flash Sale and On Sale Now, displaying discounted products with prices and discount percentages.
  - A Categories section listing product categories like Microphones, Shorts, Gym Equipments, etc.
  - A Just For You section with recommended products and their details.
  - A "Load More" button for additional product loading.

## Features
- **Navigation Bar**: Links for app savings, selling on Daraz, help, login, and signup.
- **Search Functionality**: A search bar (represented by a magnifying glass emoji) for users to find products.
- **Flash Sale Section**: Highlights time-sensitive deals with product images, names, prices, and discounts.
- **Product Listings**: Displays products with details like name, price, original price, and discount percentage.
- **Categories**: A sidebar or section for browsing products by category (e.g., Microphones, Footwear, Bags).
- **Just For You**: Personalized product recommendations with similar details to the sale sections.
- **Responsive Design**: The HTML structure is designed to be adaptable for styling with CSS for responsive layouts (CSS not included in the provided file).

## Usage
1. **Open the Page**: Load `daraz.html` in a web browser to view the static webpage.
2. **Customization**: 
   - Add CSS to style the page for better visuals and responsiveness.
   - Implement JavaScript for dynamic features like search functionality, product filtering, or "Load More" button behavior.
   - Connect to a backend to fetch real product data or handle user interactions like login/signup.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Content**: Integrate with a backend API to dynamically load products and categories.
- **Styling**: Apply CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS) for a modern, responsive design.
- **Interactivity**: Add JavaScript for features like product filtering, search, and cart functionality.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the webpage meets WCAG standards for accessibility.
- **Database Integration**: Store product details, user data, and categories in a database for scalability.

## Notes
- The provided HTML is a static mockup and lacks CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
- Emojis (e.g., üõí, üîç) are used as placeholders for icons; consider replacing them with proper icon libraries (e.g., Font Awesome) for production.
- The "Load More" button is currently non-functional and requires JavaScript implementation.
- Product prices and discounts are hardcoded; a real-world implementation would fetch these from a database or API.
